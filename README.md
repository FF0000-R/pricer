Trying to somewhat reverse engineer a Pricer digital price tag in the hope to be able to control its e-ink display, IR transmitter / reciever, and memory. This is mostly just for learning purposes.

## Project intoduction.

The Pricer electronic shelf label or digital price tag is a device that is meant to replace traditional price tags in all kinds of shops.
The point of this project is for a complete begginer (me) to understand clearly how this device works, how it is implemented in a system and *try* to interact with the device's firmware, maybe even upload our own.

This project was put in place by a highly inexperimented person, who obviously is **very** open to any input or discussion with anyone who is remotely interested or simply able to help. Contacts (for now) are at robin.e.debroux@gmail.com.
